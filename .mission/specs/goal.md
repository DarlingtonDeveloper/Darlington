# Goal: Kai Chat UI on Darlington.dev

## Goal Statement
Add a `/kai` page to darlington.dev where Mike (and eventually visitors) can chat with Kai directly through the website, with real-time streaming responses.

## Success Metrics
- Chat page accessible at darlington.dev/kai
- Messages stream in real-time (SSE)
- Matches existing site design (dark theme, emerald accents, mobile-first)
- Conversation persists within session
- Works on mobile
- API tokens stay server-side (Next.js API route proxies to OpenClaw)
