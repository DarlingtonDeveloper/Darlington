  "task_id": "6b99dfbca6",
  "persona": "researcher",
  "objective": "Discover what already exists for checkpoints, zones, projects, and stage override in the MC backend and Darlington frontend. Map the gaps.",
  "context": [
    "MissionControl backend (Go) lives at ~/MissionControl — REST API + WebSocket hub",
    "Darlington frontend (Next.js) lives at ~/Darlington — app/mc/ is the dashboard",
    "3A just shipped: trace view, audit trail, findings/briefings browser, specs viewer, graph visualization",
    "Backend routes are in ~/MissionControl/internal/server/ and ~/Darlington/app/api/mc/",
    "Frontend MC components are in ~/Darlington/components/mc/ and ~/Darlington/app/mc/"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "What checkpoint-related APIs exist in MissionControl? What data shape do checkpoint files use?",
    "What zone support exists? Are zones stored in tasks.jsonl? How are they used?",
    "Does mc have project management (multi-project)? What does 'mc project list' do?",
    "Is there any stage override mechanism in the REST API? What about mc stage commands?",
    "What frontend components already exist that we can extend?",
    "What WebSocket events are relevant for real-time updates?"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Explore ~/MissionControl/internal/server/ for REST routes",
    "Explore ~/MissionControl/cmd/ for CLI commands that hint at features",
    "Check ~/Darlington/app/mc/ and ~/Darlington/components/mc/ for existing frontend",
    "Check ~/Darlington/lib/mc/ for types and client code",
    "Read checkpoint JSON files in any .mission/checkpoints/ dirs for data shape",
    "Write findings to /home/mike/Darlington/.mission/findings/6b99dfbca6.md with # Summary header",
    "Mark done: /home/mike/MissionControl/dist/mc task update 6b99dfbca6 --status done"
