# Summary

## Changes Made

### `lib/mc/types.ts`

- Added `ProjectInfo` interface (`name`, `path`, `active`) for the project switcher feature

### `components/mc/mission-view.tsx`

- **Removed hardcoded `ZONES` array** — zones are now derived dynamically from `tasks` and `workers` props
- **Added `tasks: Task[]` and `checkpoints: CheckpointInfo[]` props** to `MissionViewProps`
- **Zone task breakdown**: Each zone group now shows a task status bar beneath it with counts for complete (✓), in-progress (⚙), pending (○), and blocked (✕) tasks
- **Checkpoints panel**: New section showing the 5 most recent checkpoints with stage icon, stage name, task count, auto badge, and formatted timestamp. Sorted newest-first with "+N more" overflow indicator
- **Summary bar**: Added task completion ratio (`complete/total tasks`) alongside existing worker counts

## Integration Note

The only TypeScript error is in `mc-client.tsx` which needs to pass the new `tasks` and `checkpoints` props to `<MissionView>`. This is the other worker's responsibility — the data is already available on `mcState.tasks` and `mcState.checkpoints`.
