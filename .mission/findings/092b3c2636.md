# Summary

## Goal Statement

Wire checkpoints, zones, projects, and stage override into the MC dashboard with working backend fixes.

## Outcomes

1. **Checkpoints UI**: Browse checkpoints with timestamps and stage info. Fix path mismatch so CLI-created checkpoints appear.
2. **Zones view**: Show task zones as grouped sections in mission view. Derived from task metadata.
3. **Projects switcher**: Dropdown to switch between registered MC projects. Unify the two registries (use CLI's ~/.mc/projects.json).
4. **Stage override**: Manual stage control button for operators, with confirmation dialog.
5. **Backend fixes**: Fix checkpoint path, unify project registry reading.
