# Summary

Fixed checkpoint path and project registry in MC Dashboard 3B backend.

## Changes

### `orchestrator/api/handlers.go`

1. **Checkpoint path fix**: Changed `handleCheckpoints` to read from `.mission/orchestrator/checkpoints/` (where CLI writes) instead of `.mission/checkpoints/`. Now parses `.json` files instead of looking for subdirectories. Extracts `stage`, `task_count`, and `auto` fields from checkpoint JSON.

2. **`loadCheckpoints()` helper**: Extracted checkpoint loading into a reusable method called from both `handleCheckpoints` GET and `handleStatus`.

3. **Checkpoints in `handleStatus`**: Added `checkpoints` key to the status response, enabling WebSocket initial sync to include checkpoint data automatically.

4. **Project registry fix**: Changed `handleProjects` GET to read `~/.mc/projects.json` (CLI's actual registry) instead of `~/.mission-control/config.json` (which doesn't exist). Transforms the `{name: path}` map into a `[{name, path, active}]` array sorted by name, with `active` indicating the currently loaded project.

### `orchestrator/serve/serve.go`

5. **Checkpoints in `buildState`**: Added checkpoint loading to the initial WebSocket sync state, reading from `.mission/orchestrator/checkpoints/` with the same JSON parsing logic.

## Verification

- `orchestrator` module: ✅ builds clean
- `cmd/mc` module: ✅ builds clean
