# Summary

Implemented project switcher dropdown and stage override dialog for MC Dashboard 3B.

## Changes

### `components/mc/stage-override-dialog.tsx` (NEW)

- Modal dialog with stage selector dropdown (all 10 stages with icons)
- Required reason textarea
- Visual warnings for backward moves and stage skipping
- Loading state, error handling, confirm/cancel buttons
- Dark theme, Tailwind, matches existing component patterns

### `components/mc/dashboard-header.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Added project switcher dropdown in the identity section
  - Fetches projects from `GET /api/projects` on mount
  - Shows active project with checkmark, click to switch
  - `POST /api/projects` with `{ path }` on selection
  - Outside-click-to-close behavior
- Added "Override" button next to pipeline bar
- New props: `onProjectSwitch`, `onStageOverride`

### `app/mc/mc-client.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Imported and wired `StageOverrideDialog` component
- Added `handleStageOverride` — `POST /api/stages/override` with `{ stage, reason }`
- Added `handleProjectSwitch` — triggers full page reload after switch
- Passed new props to `DashboardHeader`
- Added `tasks` and `checkpoints` props to `MissionView` (required by other worker's changes)

## Type Check

`npx tsc --noEmit` passes cleanly.
